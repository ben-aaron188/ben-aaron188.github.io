I am an Assistant Professor in Data Science at the [Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute) and the [Dawes Centre for Future Crime](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute/dawes-future-crime) at University College London. I also hold a guest affiliation at the University of Amsterdam's [Department of Psychology](http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/psychology).

I'm interested in solving and understanding (future) crime and security problems with computational techniques. My research uses a mix of open and closed-source data, and analytical and methodological approaches from natural language processing, machine learning, experimental research and simulation studies. All of my research is aimed at solving problems in the real world.

Current research questions include:

- Dynamic modelling of sentiment in text
- Hybrid decision-making approaches in uncertain environments (human-in-the-loop, i.e. integrating machine learning and human expertise)
- Leading indicators for violent crimes through social media conflict
- Automated detection of hate speech targets
- Identifying early warning signals to detect emerging crime trends
- Understanding and predicting the temporal trajectories of language on online forums
- Cryptocurrency pump-and-dump detection and mitigation
- Dynamic, adaptive information elicitation for large-scale passenger screening


Methodological topics:

- Fundamental data science, esp. the validity of online sensor data (e.g., forum data, dark web data)
- The stability of computational approaches (e.g., class-imbalance problems, context dependency of machine learning, bad label propagation for prediction models)
- New ways of generating data for crime research (e.g., simulation approaches, web-scraping)

# Software

- **NETANOS - Named entity-based text anonymization for open science**
    - Anonymises bunches of text files by removing identifiable information
    - de-identifies numbers, persons, locations, places, pronouns, dates and times
    - Developed with [Maximilian Mozes](http://www.mmozes.net/) and [Bruno Verschuere](http://www.uva.nl/profiel/v/e/b.j.verschuere/b.j.verschuere.html)
    - Available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netanos), source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/ben-aaron188/netanos)
    - Published paper in [JOSS](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/cd40892f7ea198aded1bc90ba33c6655) and experimental validation on [OSF servers](https://osf.io/w9nhb/)
    - Accessible interface version lives on [netanos.io](http://netanos.io/)

Example:

```javascript
var input = "Max and Ben spent more than 1000 hours on writing the software. They started in August 2016 in Amsterdam.";

netanos.anon(input, function(output) {
    console.log(output);
});

/*
"[PERSON_1] and [PERSON_2] spent more than [DATE/TIME_1] on writing the software. They started in [DATE/TIME_2] in [LOCATION_1]."
*/
```


- **Naive context sentiment analysis**
    -  Performs sentiment analysis that handles valence shifters (e.g., "really", "not", "hardly", "but") on non-punctuated or poorly punctuated data
    -  Code lives [on GitHub](https://github.com/ben-aaron188/naive_context_sentiment)
    -  Specific use cases:
        - data that are not punctuated at all (e.g., auto-generated YouTube transcripts)
        - data that are badly punctuated (e.g., data from blogs where punctuation is not necessarily a given)
        - very brief text data: Twitter data, for example, even if properly annotated for sentence-boundary-disambiguation, would return one or two sentiment values with other sentiment extraction packages
