### Bennett Kleinberg

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Methodology and Statistics](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/socialsciences/organization/departments/methodology-statistics) at Tilburg University and an Honorary Associate Professor at the [Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute) at University College London.

Previously I've held positions with the [Dawes Centre for Future Crime](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute/dawes-future-crime) at University College London and the University of Amsterdam's [Department of Psychology](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-social-and-behavioural-sciences/disciplines/psychology/psychology.html). I obtained my PhD form the Department of Psychology at the University of Amsterdam.

#### Research



My research interests revolve around behavioural inference with two core questions: (1) How can we study and understand human behaviour through computational methods? and (2) How can we make inferences about the behaviour of computational models with methods from the behavioural sciences? Of particular interest is the intersection between the behavioural (and social) sciences and natural language processing.
Questions I'm currently interested in and working on:

- How can we use text data to study human behaviour and cognition?
- How can we formally measure the processes through which a large language model produces its outputs?
- How (if at all!) can we use observational online data to _measure_ and _predict_ behaviour? And how can we (as online users) prevent this?
- Which assumptions do we (need to) make when working with text data and are these valid assumptions?
- What are the methodological pitfalls of either discipline and how can we fix this?
- How can tools/methods of either discipline help the other?
- How can we use NLP to ask better questions for deception detection?

Other research interests are about applying computational techniques to questions around crime, deception, threat assessment (see the research areas of my PhD students below).

I'm also one of the inventors of [Textwash](https://textwash.co.uk/) - an automated, learning-based text anonymisation software and [SAGE Ocean concept grant winner](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/press/sage-ocean-announces-text-wash-as-2019-concept-grant-winner). Some [(more info here)](https://ocean.sagepub.com/concept-grants) and [(interviews on YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9pRRn2DrMY).
