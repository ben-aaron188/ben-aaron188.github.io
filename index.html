#### Research



My research interests are between the behavioural sciences and natural language processing. Some projects are right at the intersection, others lean more to either area.


Questions I'm currently interested in and working on:

- How can we use text data to study human behaviour and cognition?
- How (if at all!) can we use observational online data to _measure_, _predict_ and _change_ behaviour? And how can we (as online users) prevent this?
- Which assumptions do we (need to) make when working with text data and are these valid assumptions?
- How does the flexibility that we (reseachers) have affect NLP research?
- What are the methodological pitfalls of either discipline and how can we fix this?
- How can tools/methods of either discipline help the other?
- How can we use NLP to ask better questions for deception detection?

Other research interests are about applying computational techniques to questions around crime, deception, threat assessment (see the research areas of my PhD students below).

I'm also one of the inventors of [Textwash](https://textwash.co.uk/) - an automated, learning-based text anonymisation software and [SAGE Ocean concept grant winner](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/press/sage-ocean-announces-text-wash-as-2019-concept-grant-winner). More on the project soon. In the meantime, some [(more info here)](https://ocean.sagepub.com/concept-grants) and [(interviews on YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9pRRn2DrMY).

  ## Software

  - NETANOS - Named entity-based text anonymization for open science
      - Anonymises bunches of text files by removing identifiable information
      - de-identifies numbers, persons, locations, places, pronouns, dates and times
      - Developed with [Maximilian Mozes](http://www.mmozes.net/) and [Bruno Verschuere](http://www.uva.nl/profiel/v/e/b.j.verschuere/b.j.verschuere.html)
      - Available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netanos), source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/ben-aaron188/netanos)
      - Published paper in [JOSS](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/cd40892f7ea198aded1bc90ba33c6655) and experimental validation on [OSF servers](https://osf.io/w9nhb/)
      - Accessible interface version lives on [netanos.io](http://netanos.io/)
  - Naive context sentiment analysis
      -  Performs sentiment analysis that handles valence shifters (e.g., "really", "not", "hardly", "but") on non-punctuated or poorly punctuated data
      -  Code lives [on GitHub](https://github.com/ben-aaron188/naive_context_sentiment)
      -  Specific use cases:
          - data that are not punctuated at all (e.g., auto-generated YouTube transcripts)
          - data that are badly punctuated (e.g., data from blogs where punctuation is not necessarily a given)
          - very brief text data: Twitter data, for example, even if properly annotated for sentence-boundary-disambiguation, would return one or two sentiment values with other sentiment extraction packages
